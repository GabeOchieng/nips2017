**Note**: This repository is deprecated.

The repository **contained** code to reproduce the results of the paper:

```bash
@inproceedings{Hofer17c,
  author    = {C.~Hofer and R.~Kwitt and M.~Niethammer and A.~Uhl},
  title     = {Deep Learning with Topological Signatures},
  booktitle = {NIPS},
  year      = 2017}
```

The same experiments (and additional ones) can be found [here](https://github.com/c-hofer/jmlr_2019) which is the repository for the extended JMLR publication.
